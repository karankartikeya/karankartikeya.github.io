    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
    <p>
      This privacy policy applies to the SlideCoach app (hereby referred to as
      "Application") for mobile devices that was created by SlideCoach (hereby
      referred to as "Service Provider") as a free service. This service is
      intended for use "AS IS".
    </p>

    <br /><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
    <p>
      The Application collects information when you download and use it. This
      may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)</li>
      <li>Pages visited, time spent in the app, and usage statistics</li>
      <li>Operating system of your device</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Application does not gather precise location data of your mobile
      device.
    </p>

    <br /><strong>Use of Camera and Microphone</strong>
    <p>
      The Application requests access to your deviceâ€™s camera and microphone to
      enable real-time presentation recording, feedback, video sessions, and
      communication features. These permissions are essential for the core
      functionality of the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app does not collect or store camera or microphone input without your
      explicit consent. Any media recorded is processed only for user-requested
      features such as performance feedback and is not shared with third parties
      unless explicitly required for those services.
    </p>

    <br /><strong>Personal Information</strong>
    <p>
      For a better experience, while using the Application, we may require you
      to provide personally identifiable information, including but not limited
      to your email and name. This information is retained and used as described
      in this privacy policy.
    </p>

    <br /><strong>Third-Party Access</strong>
    <p>
      Only aggregated, anonymized data may be shared with third-party services
      to help us improve the Application and its features.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations or government requests</li>
      <li>To protect user safety, investigate fraud, or respond to incidents</li>
      <li>
        With trusted service providers who act on our behalf under strict
        confidentiality agreements
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br /><strong>Analytics and Third-Party Tools</strong>
    <p>
      We may use third-party tools such as Google Analytics for Firebase or
      Sentry to collect anonymized usage data. These tools help us understand
      how users interact with the app and improve performance. No personal media
      content is accessed or stored by these tools.
    </p>

    <br /><strong>Opt-Out Rights</strong>
    <p>
      You can stop all collection of information by the Application by
      uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device or
      through your app store.
    </p>

    <br /><strong>Data Retention Policy</strong>
    <p>
      We will retain user-provided data for as long as you use the Application
      and for a reasonable time afterward. To request deletion of your data,
      please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@slidecoach.ai">support@slidecoach.ai</a>.
    </p>

    <br /><strong>Children</strong>
    <p>
      We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
      children under the age of 13. Parents and guardians are encouraged to
      supervise children's use of the app. If you believe a child has provided
      personal data, please contact us immediately.
    </p>

    <br /><strong>Security</strong>
    <p>
      We implement physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect
      your information from unauthorized access or disclosure.
    </p>

    <br /><strong>Changes to This Policy</strong>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. You are advised to
      review this page periodically for any changes. Continued use of the app
      implies acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>

    <p><em>Effective date: 2025-08-01</em></p>
